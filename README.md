**MSc:** Data Science and Advanced Analytics, NOVA IMS   
**Grade:** 17.03 out of 20  
   
### Description 
The objective is to show how we managed to use visualization concepts and techniques to transform data into a meaningful interactive visualization.

Using a Formula1 dataset, we created a dashboard to provide some informations through visualizations, which can be much more intuitive and easy to interpret than looking at the data itself.
